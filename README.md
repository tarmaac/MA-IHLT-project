final Lab project of Introduction to Human Languages Techonologies.


Evaluation Measure
In this task, pearson correlation is used for comparison purposes. It is available in python through the scipy module:
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
pearsonr(refs, tsts)[0]


Statement

Use data set and description of task Semantic Textual Similarity in SemEval 2012.

Implement some approaches to detect paraphrase using sentence similarity metrics.

Explore some lexical dimensions.
Explore the syntactic dimension alone.
Explore the combination of both previous.
Add new components at your choice (optional).

Already generated word or sentence embeddings models are not allowed, such as BERT.

Compare and comment the results achieved by these approaches among them and among the official results.
